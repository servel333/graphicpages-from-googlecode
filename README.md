------------------------------------

Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/graphicpages

Planned to be an advanced comic viewer/image feed reader that downloads the 'pages' to the local device, caching them, and allows the user to view them later. Loosely modeled after Google Listen.

### 0.1.0 initial non-market beta release:

* View Questionable Content comic
* Downloads files to phone and displays them, making later review fast.

### 0.1.1 non-market release

* The 'list downloaded files' in the menu renamed to "List Files and Go-to"
* In this view, clicking a page will go to that page.
* Added a simple downloading indicator
* The title of the page now changes very soon after the button is pressed to indicate what's about to happen.
* other internal cleanup

### 0.1.2 non-market release

* Moved the newer/older/etc... buttons to floating on the bottom
* Removed the 'Quit' menu item.
* Added a (not implemented) 'purge files' menu item to the list files activity.
* Other changes in pursuit of long-term goals.
