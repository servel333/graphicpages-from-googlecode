== View subscriptions ==
 * A subscription could be a web comic, RSS feed, Atom feed or other feed
 * A subscription contains pages
 * A 'page' is a single image in the comic/feed (or perhaps a set of images for complex comics)

== Automatically download new pages to the local disk ==
 * As new pages become available in the subscription, the application should automatically download them (depending on settings) and store them locally
 * Downloaded pages should be available to the other image viewers on the application (added to the media ContentProvider)

== Get next/last page when browsing pages ==
 * When viewing comics, asynchronically download the next comic in the sequence, then the previous one

== Save lists of viewed comics ==
 * Store the 'read' or 'viewed' state of pages
 * Optionally discard viewed comics (when space is needed only?)

== Bookmarks ==
 * automatically save the last page viewed in a sequence
 ** Browsing from in the middle of a sequence

== Jump to page ==
 * Jump to page by date or number

== Starred pages ==
 * Starred pages are not automatically deleted
